          <h2>Watch_Dogs</h2>
          <p>
            Watch Dogs (stylized as WATCH_DOGS) is an action-adventure video
            game franchise published by Ubisoft, and developed primarily by its
            Montreal and Toronto studios using the Disrupt game engine.[1] The
            series' eponymous first title was released in 2014, and it has
            featured three games in total, the most recent being 2020's Watch
            Dogs: Legion. Several tie-in books and comic book miniseries set in
            the games' universe have also been published. Gameplay in the Watch
            Dogs games focuses on an open world where the player can complete
            missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various
            side activities. The core gameplay consists of driving, shooting,
            and stealth segments, with occasional role-playing and puzzle
            elements. The Watch Dogs games are set in fictionalized versions of
            real-life cities, at various points in time, and follow different
            hacker protagonists who, while having different goals to achieve,
            find themselves involved with the criminal underworlds of their
            respective cities. The antagonists are usually corrupt companies,
            crime bosses, and rival hackers who take advantage of ctOS (central
            Operating System), a fictional computing network that connects every
            electronic device in a city together into a single system and stores
            personal information on most citizens. The player also has access to
            ctOS, which can be used to control various devices to assist them in
            combat, stealth, or solving puzzles. The games have received
            generally positive reviews for their gameplay elements, mission
            structure, and world design, with criticism for frequent technical
            issues, while the narratives and characters have garnered mixed
            reactions. The series has been financially successful, with lifetime
            sales for the first two games exceeding 20 million units in
            total.[2]

          <h2>Watch_Dogs 1 (2014) </h2>
          <p>Set within a fictionalized version of the Chicago metropolitan area in 2013, the first installment in the series follows gray hat hacker and vigilante Aiden Pearce's quest for revenge after the killing of his niece. The game's development began in 2009, with a budget of $68 million.[3][4] Watch Dogs was derived from a potential sequel from the Driver series which had been in development at Ubisoft Montreal coincident to Driver: San Francisco at Ubisoft Reflections and was released in 2011. Driver: San Francisco did not have a strong commercial performance, leading to the Driver game at Montreal being reworked into one that focused on hacking but still incorporated driving elements.[5] Ubisoft Montreal was Watch Dogs' lead developer, with additional support provided by Ubisoft Reflections, Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Quebec, and Ubisoft Bucharest.[6] The game was heavily anticipated following its gameplay reveal at E3 2012, though the final game, which was accused of graphical downgrading, triggered controversy.[7] The game was released for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in May 2014, and a Wii U version was released in November 2014.[8]

            Downloadable content (DLC) for the game, titled Watch Dogs: Bad Blood, was released in September 2014. Starring Raymond "T-Bone" Kenney, a main character from the base game's story, as the playable protagonist, the DLC adds ten story missions, new "Street Sweep" contracts, as wells as new weapons, outfits, side missions, and an RC car.[9]</p>

          <h2>Watch_Dogs 2 (2016) </h2>
          <p>Set within a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, Watch Dogs 2 follows the story of hacker Marcus Holloway, who is punished for a crime he did not commit through ctOS 2.0, and joins the hacking group DedSec in their efforts to raise social awareness about the dangers posed by ctOS 2.0. and expose the corruption of its creators, the Blume company. This installment expanded upon the multiplayer options from the first game and introduced new weapons and gadgets. Unlike Watch Dogs, the game features a much more vibrant and optimistic tone.[10] Ubisoft Montreal was the game's lead developer, with Ubisoft's studios in Toronto, Paris, Bucharest, Kyiv and Newcastle assisting the development.[11] Watch Dogs 2 was released in November 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[12]

            Five downloadable content packs for the game have been released: the "T-Bone Content Bundle", "Human Conditions", "No Compromise", "Root Access Bundle", and "Psychedelic Pack".[13][14] As per an exclusivity agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, all DLCs were timed exclusives for PlayStation 4.[15]
            Root Access Bundle (available in December 2016)[16] and Psychedelic Pack (available on launch day) feature a Zodiac Killer mission as well as new outfits, cars, skins, and weapons.[13][14]
            The T-Bone Content Bundle was released for PlayStation 4 on December 22, 2016,[17] and includes a new co-op difficulty setting, "Mayhem", plus the clothes and truck of Raymond "T-Bone" Kenney.[13][14]
            Human Conditions was released on February 21, 2017, for the PlayStation 4 and on March 23 for the Xbox One and PC,[18] and includes three new stories set in San Francisco's science and medicine industries. The pack also includes new co-op missions featuring a new enemy class called "the Jammer", a technologically savvy enemy capable of jamming all of a player's hacker equipment, making them vulnerable to head-on attacks.[13][14]
            No Compromise was released on April 18, 2017, for PlayStation 4 and was launched on May 18 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, featuring a new story mission, outfits and weapons.[19]</p>

            <h2>Watch_Dogs Legion (2020)</h2>
            <p>Set within a fictionalised representation of a futuristic, dystopian London, Watch Dogs: Legion follows the local branch of DedSec as they seek to clear their names after being framed for a series of terrorist bombings. DedSec also attempt to liberate London's citizens from the control of Albion, an oppressive private military company which turned the city into a surveillance state following the bombings.[20] The game introduces a multiple playable characters system, allowing players to recruit virtually any NPC found in the game's open world. Each playable character has their own unique skills and backgrounds, and can be lost permanently if players enable the option of permadeath before starting a new game. There are multiple ways to complete missions depending on which playable character is selected.[21] Ubisoft Toronto led the game's development, with Clint Hocking serving as its creative director.[22] Legion was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia on October 29, 2020; PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were also made available once the consoles released.[23]

                The game's online multiplayer component, which was delayed from its planned December 3 release to March 2021,[24][25] allows up to four players to complete exclusive cooperative missions, participate in various competitive game modes, or simply explore London together. Following its release, Legion was supported with several free updates that added new missions, game modes, and characters, including a number of special operatives, such as Mina Sidhu, a former test subject who has gained mind-control powers; Aiden Pearce, returning from the original Watch Dogs; Wrench, a major supporting character from Watch Dogs 2; and Darcy Clarkson, a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, as part of a non-canonical crossover with Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed franchise.[26] A paid story expansion titled Watch Dogs: Legion - Bloodline, featuring Aiden and Wrench in a new storyline set after their respective games but before the events of Legion's main campaign, was released on July 6, 2021.[27]</p>
